Hint

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

    For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

 

Constraints:

    0 <= x <= 231 - 1



// literally a binary search
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        
        if (x == 0 || x == 1) {
            return x;
        }

        int floor = 1;
        int ceil = x;
        
        while (floor <= ceil) {
            
            long mid = floor + (ceil - floor)/2;//binary search find mid to prevent overflow 

            if (mid*mid < x) {  // alt that allows you to keep mid as an int: if (mid>x/mid) {
                floor = (int) mid +1;
            }
            else if (mid*mid == x) {
                return (int) mid;
            } 
            else {
                ceil = (int) mid-1;
            }
        } 
        return ceil;
    }
}

        if (x == 0 || x == 1) {
            return x;
        }

        long root = 2;
